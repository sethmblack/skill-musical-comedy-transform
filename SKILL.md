# Musical Comedy Transform

Add musical elements (rhythm, rhyme, melodic structure) to prose content, transforming it into song-worthy or rhythmically engaging material in the Eric Idle musical comedy tradition.

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Content requires technical precision where rhythm would obscure meaning
- Legal, medical, or safety-critical information that cannot be altered
- Subject matter is inappropriate for musical treatment (genuine tragedy, crisis)
- Rhyming would trivialize legitimate suffering

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Musical treatment should enhance memorability, not mock serious subjects
- Maintain factual accuracy when setting information to rhythm
- Ensure rhyme serves communication, not just cleverness
- Respect when some content genuinely resists musical transformation

**Note:** This skill creates LYRICS and RHYTHMIC PROSE, not actual musical notation or melodies. You cannot compose music, but you can write material suitable for musical performance.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when you detect:

- **List-worthy content** - Steps, items, or points that could become verses
- **Educational material** - Information that needs to be memorable
- **Boring but important** - Dry content that would benefit from entertainment value
- **Performance context** - Material that might be spoken or performed aloud
- **Repetitive structure** - Patterns that suggest chorus/verse format
- **User requests** - Explicit asks for "make it a song," "add rhythm," "musical version"

**Key trigger phrases:**
- "Turn this into a song"
- "Make this more musical"
- "Can you add rhymes?"
- "Give this the Monty Python song treatment"
- "Make this memorable"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `content` | Yes | Text to transform into musical/rhythmic form | Must have clear points or structure |
| `musical_style` | No | Target style (silly song, educational tune, patter song, etc.) | Default: upbeat musical comedy |
| `preserve_info` | No | Information that must remain factually accurate | List of non-negotiable facts |
| `rhyme_scheme` | No | Desired rhyme pattern (AABB, ABAB, etc.) | Default: varies by verse |
| `performance_context` | No | Where/how this will be performed | Informs energy level |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify:

- **Key points** - What information must be conveyed?
- **Natural groupings** - How do ideas cluster into verses?
- **Potential chorus** - Is there a central message or refrain?
- **Tone** - Serious info needing fun delivery? Already silly? Educational?
- **Length constraints** - Short and punchy vs. elaborate production number?

### Step 2: Build the bones:



### Step 3: Apply strategic rhyming:



### Step 4: Create memorable hook:





## Outputs

**Transformed content featuring:**
- Clear verse structure (and chorus if appropriate)
- Consistent rhythm and meter
- Strategic rhyme schemes
- Musical comedy sensibility
- Original message preserved in entertaining form
- Performable quality (could be sung or spoken dramatically)

**Format options:**
- Full song with verses and chorus
- Rhythmic prose with internal rhyme
- Patter piece for rapid delivery
- Simple verse with refrain

**May include:**
- [Suggested melody note: upbeat, silly, music hall, etc.]
- (Stage directions for performance)
- [CHORUS] markers
- Performance notes

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content resists musical structure | Explain which elements could be rhythmic vs. which need prose. Hybrid approach. |
| Rhymes feel forced | Prioritize rhythm over rhyme. Near-rhymes or unrhymed rhythmic verse acceptable. |
| Too much info to fit in song | Create medley of short songs, or identify core points for musical treatment. |
| Technical accuracy conflicts with rhyme | Accuracy wins. Adjust rhyme, not facts. |
| User wants actual musical notation | Clarify that you create lyrics/rhythm, not melodies. Suggest collaboration with musician. |

## Example 1: Educational Content as Song

### Input Content
"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. Chlorophyll in the leaves absorbs light energy. Carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil are combined. This produces glucose for the plant and releases oxygen into the atmosphere."

### Musical Comedy Transform Output

**The Photosynthesis Song**
*(To be sung with bouncy, educational enthusiasm)*

[VERSE 1]
Oh, plants are rather clever, as it happens,
They've worked out how to eat the sun for lunch!
With chlorophyll - that's green stuff in their leaf-bits -
They grab the light and give it quite a crunch.

[CHORUS]
Photosynthesis! Photo-jolly-synthesis!
It's how a plant survives without a mouth!
They're turning light to food whilst looking innocent,
And giving us the oxygen - howouth!

[VERSE 2]
They steal the carbon dioxide that you're breathing,
Mix in some water from the underground,
Combine them in their cellular green factories,
And glucose is the treasure that they've found!

[CHORUS]
Photosynthesis! Photo-jolly-synthesis!
It's solar power for the vegetation!
They make their food from sunshine and pollution,
Then oxygen pops out - what brilliant operation!

[BRIDGE]
So thank a plant today for all its efforts,
Converting light to life through chemistry,
Without their photosynthetic dedication,
We'd all stop breathing - that's biology!

[FINAL CHORUS]
Photosynthesis! Photo-bloody-synthesis!
The plants are doing science all day long!
So always look on the bright side of chlorophyll,
And remember that the plants deserve this song!

*(Whistle break, obviously)*

## Example 2: Patter Song for Complex Process

### Input Content
"To debug code effectively: First, reproduce the error consistently. Second, isolate the problem area. Third, form a hypothesis about the cause. Fourth, test your hypothesis systematically. Fifth, fix the issue. Sixth, verify the fix doesn't break anything else."

### Musical Comedy Transform Output

**The Debugging Dance**
*(Fast patter song, Gilbert & Sullivan style)*

When your code is misbehaving and the errors multiply,
When the console's full of red text and you're wondering WHY OH WHY,
Don't panic, don't despair, there's a method to apply,
It's the Debugging Dance, and we'll teach you on the fly!

First reproduce the error - make it happen once again!
If you cannot make it crash reliably, well then,
You're chasing random ghosts through your functions and your loops,
So nail it down precisely before breaking into groups!

Second: isolate the problem (that's detective work, you see),
Is it here in function Alpha or perhaps in function B?
Comment out your code in chunks until the beast appears,
Binary search your codebase - it's the method of the years!

Third: hypothesize the cause - make your educated guess,
"I bet it's scope!" or "null returns!" or "asynchronous mess!"
Form a theory that explains the symptoms that you've seen,
Then test it systematically - don't just hope and dream!

Fourth: testing, fifth: the fixing, sixth: verify it all,
Make sure your clever patch doesn't make something else fall,
Run your tests, check edge cases, then deploy with confidence,
You've completed the Debugging Dance - it all makes perfect sense!

*(Repeat with increasingly frantic tempo)*
